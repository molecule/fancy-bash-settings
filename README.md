# fancy-bash-settings
- Nice bash settings. 
- Works on Mac and Linux.

## Usage
1. Open ~/.bashrc ```vim ~/.bashrc```
2. Copy and paste the contents of the .bashrc file in this repo into that new .bashrc file.
3. Save and quit vim ```<esc> :wq```
4. source it, or open a new terminal window to get it to reload: ```source ~/.bashrc```
5. Your terminal text should now be a different colour. If you can't read the text now, open Terminal -> Preferences -> Profiles and select one of the dark ones. The colours should all pop out and be highly visible now.
